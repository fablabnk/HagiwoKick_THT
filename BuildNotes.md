## Things to pay attention to whilst building

## Design issues to fix in V1.1
- DONE: thicken traces to 30 mil (power) and 20 mil (signals)
- DONE: pots should be marked B (linear)
- DONE: LED footprint is too big (should be 3mm as with other modules)
- DONE: Widen distance between 10uF cap pins from 1.5 to 2.0 (footprint exchange)
