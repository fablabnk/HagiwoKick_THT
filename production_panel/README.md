# HagiwoKick Faceplate  

## Overview  
This is the **faceplate design** for the **HagiwoKick module**, a Eurorack drum module based on Hagiwo's design. The layout follows standard Eurorack dimensions and mounting specifications.  

## Dimensions  
- **Front Panel Width:** 6HP (30.00mm x 128.5mm)  
- **Mounting Holes:** 3.2mm x 5.2mm oval (per Doepfer standard)  

## Laser Cutting and Engraving Guidelines  
- **Cutting Lines:** **Red (0.01mm stroke width)** – Defines the panel shape, mounting holes, and cutouts.  
- **Engraving Lines:** **Black** – Used for text, labels, and graphics.  

## Design Notes  
- **Power Source:** 5V provided from the **Arduino**, not the Eurorack 5V rail.  
- **Patch Submodule Capacitors:** Uses **22uF ceramic** instead of **10uF electrolytic**.  
- **Component Placement:** Capacitors should be positioned closer to the Arduino for noise suppression.  
- **Faceplate Size:** Matches the previous **Mixer** module for consistency.
